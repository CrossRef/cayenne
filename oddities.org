* Unixref coming back from OAI-PMH
** Journal articles with duplicated identical publication dates.
* Unixref Schema
** XSD lists "subtitle" element twice under "titles". 
   Is one potentially original language subtitle?
** Deposit schema specifies 0 to 5 affiliations per person_name, unixref doesn't specify
   a max or min

* Intentionally missing from unixref.clj parsing
** DOI timestamps
** Some DOI resource collection info such as setById, multi-res lock/unlock, collection types
** Some DOI resource item types - country and labelled
** noisbn element and its reason attribute
** publication_type for content_item, papers, dissertation, etc

* Should be items
** Location of publishers
** Location of conferences
